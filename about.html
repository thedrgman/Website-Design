				<p class="section">This website is to demonstrate our work that we have done and a place that you may easily contact. If you are looking for wedding, engagement, and family photography then you are in the right place. See our portfolio and see our style of shooting. If you like what you see we would love to meet with you and plan out your session.</p> 
				<p class="section">In the creation of this website I went down the list of things that were needed in my website and at the sametime making it all flow and look well together.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="section">I used this specific design choice because it is very pleasing to the eye but also looking elegantly. It also reminds them of wedding decorations. All of the pages used the same color schemes of light color and the textured background. Two fonts were used throughout the wedsite; the cursive font was used for titles and to make it look more elegant, while the other font is used for the rest of the text to make it easier to read. For the home screen I put it so it showed all of the services we provide and an example of each, they also linked to the portfolio page. The portfolio page is designed as a gallary to make it easy for the visitor to browse through the photos. The contacts page is designed to make it easy for the visitor to reqest a quote from us. The testimonials page is broken with each testimonial in its own block, this creates a good seperation from each other. The about page has each section broken out into their own blocks also. Lastly, the client page is set up so it is easy to click on the link and go to the client portal. By making everything centered and light colored I was able to give the appeal of being professional and areas of interaction large makes it easy to use.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="section">I would like for there to be an area in the website that the client is able to easily book an appointment in the calender. In addition, I would like a page that would have a live feed of the postings on Facebook and Instagram. If I had more time I would have each service on their own page and also add more sevices. With each service I would add a lot of photos for them to go through to help them. Instead of the photos going down the page the photos could be inside of a slideshow that the guest can easily skip through.</p>
