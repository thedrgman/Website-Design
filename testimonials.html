					<p>Wow! It was an all around amazing experience. Not only did we get pictures that we absolutely love but we had a great time getting them taken. They made my 6mo old feel so comfortable during the photo shoot that she wanted to just keep getting photos taken. The Gameiroâ€™s were professional, organized, and fun. They were so affordable and got our pictures back to us very quickly. I would recommend them for any kind of photography.</p>

					<p>David and Mayara Gameiro were so pleasant to work with. I could tell they really cared about me and my husband. My photography session with them made me realize how important it is that the photographer be able to set a tone that is upbeat. Mayara and David have that skill. They made picture taking a breezy, fun experience. As it should be.</p>
